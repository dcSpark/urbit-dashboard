# Change Log

## [1.0.0] 2021-02-12
### Original Release
- Started project with Material-UI Create-React-App: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app
- Added Material-UI as base framework
- Added React Hooks
- Added design from Argon Dashboard React by Creative Tim
- Added features from Argon Dashboard React by Creative Tim (such as routing system and components)
- **The TypeScript dependencies are installed only to stop console warnings on install. They are not actually used in our product. So the product is not on TypeScript!**
- We have this warning `npm WARN react-datetime@3.0.4 requires a peer of react@^16.5.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.` which will be solved in our next update, if not, we'll replace react-datetime with something else
